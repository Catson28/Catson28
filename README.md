### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Catson28/Catson28** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears in your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->


- 🔭 I'm currently working on fullstack applications, "php, python", react and docker...

- 🌱 My name is Feliciano Francisco Candieiro or simply Catson, I have a degree in Computer Science from the higher polytechnic institute of the katyavala bwila university, Angola. I like to consider myself multifaceted (or even polyglot in the case of programming languages) for carrying out different types of work or using different types of technologies.

- 👯 At the moment I'm looking for DataOps mentorship, projects that I can learn or if possible to volunteer if I have the ability to contribute, to help the organization that I'm placed and my growth as a Dataops engineer..

- 🤔 The passion for custom web development pushed me unintentionally into a work area (Photography and Videography), which became another profession for me or entertainment in my spare time.

- 💬 I'm learning how to implement and deploy full-cycle applications (big-data) with Terraform (and not only)...

- 📫 How to reach me: through the social networks below.

- 😄 Pronouns: Candieiro

- ⚡🤦🏾‍♂️ Curiosity: I'm Angolan.
